## Compile & Run

The source code of our paper are in the folder "src".

The source code of each algorithm has four parameters, corresponding to the dataset name (e.g., **D1**) and the three positive integers $k$, $l$ and $\theta$  (e.g., **(2,4,8)**).

* Compile

  > g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp graph.cpp -O3 -o main


* Run
  
  > ./main D1 2 4 8


## Datasets

We provide two sample datasets in the folder "sample_dataset" for testing, D1 and D2.
